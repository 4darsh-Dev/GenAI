The graph was done by taking a sample of ice and another sample was taken from the atmosphere. For the ice sample, drilling a hole through the ice sheets and looking at the air molecules inside the sample determined the concentration of CO 2 and m ethane (Chasing Ice). The graph illustrates that carbon dioxide levels have increased nearly 38 percent from 1750 - 2009 and methane levels have incre ased 148 percent (Riebeek ). Effects of Climate Change Climate change has affected many aspects of our planet. One aspect that has been greatly affected by climate change is the weather. In Romania, for instance, extreme weather events have multiplied since 2002. Burghila et al. stated in “Climate Change Effe cts- Where to Next?”,  that the country’s 2007 drought was the severest in 60 years ( 408).
